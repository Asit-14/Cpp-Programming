## About

This repository contains a curated set of C++ programs designed to teach you core concepts, algorithms, and practical skills. Our goal is to provide a hands-on learning experience by including:

- **Fundamental C++ programs** (syntax, data types, control structures, OOP, etc.)
- **Advanced concepts** (templates, STL, file handling, multithreading, etc.)
- **Modules** for structured learning
- **Useful libraries** for real-world development

## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Asit-14/C-plus-plus.git
cd C-plus-plus
```

You can compile and run the C++ programs using any standard C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++).

## Modules

Explore structured modules to guide your learning:

- `Basics`: Variables, Data Types, Input/Output, Operators
- `Control Flow`: If/Else, Switch, Loops
- `Functions`: Declaration, Overloading, Recursion
- `Object-Oriented Programming`: Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism
- `Templates & STL`: Vectors, Maps, Algorithms
- `File Handling`: Reading/Writing files
- `Exception Handling`
- `Advanced Topics`: Multithreading, Smart Pointers

Each module contains sample programs and explanations.

## Libraries

This repository also features example usages and custom implementations of popular C++ libraries, such as:

- Standard Template Library (STL)
- Custom utility libraries
- Third-party libraries (as applicable)

Refer to the `/libraries` folder for more information.
